class Publisher:

    # I struggled with trying to reuse the socket/port between the REP/REQ portion communicating
    # with the registry, and then switching over to PUB/SUB for the broker. I ended up testing
    # whether this was an issue with reusing the port by incrementing the bind port for the second
    # part - this worked and is why there are +/- 1 in the code for binds and publish. I plan to go
    # through and rework this into an argument at some point.
