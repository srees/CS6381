# Please see the corresponding hints in the cs6381_publisher.py file
# to see how an abstract class is defined and then two specialized classes
# are defined based on the dissemination approach. Something similar
# may have to be done here. If dissemination is direct, then each subscriber
# will have to connect to each separate publisher with whom we match.
# For the ViaBroker approach, the broker is our only publisher for everything.
