# If you decide to do the RPC approach, you might need a proxy for the
# real broker.
#
# This is the proxy object for the broker which is held by both the
# publisher and subscriber-side middleware to store info about the
# whereabouts of the actual broker. The application level logic does not
# know that it is talking to a proxy object. It will simply invoke methods
# on the proxy, which then get translated under the hood into the appropriate
# serialization logic and sending to the real broker
