# A proxy for the publisher will be used in a remote procedure call
# approach.  We envision its use on the broker side when
# it delegates the work to the proxy to talk to its real counterpart. 
# One may completely avoid this approach if pure message passing is
# going to be used and not have a higher level remote procedure call approach.
